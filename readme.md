#Readytalk Jenkins Theme

Based on the [doony](https://github.com/kevinburke/doony) theme and our [fork](https://github.com/stormbeta/doony) of it.

Also includes elements from the Atlasssian Jenkins theme.

Most of the customizations are to support newer versions of jenkins or work around bugs with various plugins.

###Usage

* Create a local folder on your jenkins master and copy the css/js and svg files to it.

* Configure the Simple Theme Plugin to point to the css and js file paths
